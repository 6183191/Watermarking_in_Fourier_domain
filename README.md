Watermarking in Fourier domain
==========================

Goal
----

In this tutorial you will learn:

-   how to embed an invisible watermark in Fourier domain

Theory
------

Theory is based on well known Digital Image Processing (Gonsalez) book

Result
------

MSE - mean-squared error.
PSNR - Peak signal to noise ratio.

MSE =  7.7866

PSNR = 39.2173
